# QA Project - Invetory Management System.

The projects goal is to build an Invetory Management System for a game store using the CRUD database methods, allowing end users to CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE records from a database.
This will be achived by the use of Eclipse for our IDE, GitHub for our repository management, Jenkins as our CI server (using codes pushed from github), and lastely SonarQube for code quality and testing (pushed from jenkins).

## Getting Started

End user will need to first donload repository to local client
using appropriate IDE link to desired MySQL Database by editing ip address in each DaO file and IMS file.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Break down into which tests and what they do

### Unit Tests 

Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

```
Give an example
